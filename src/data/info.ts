  jobDescription: "Data Scientist",
  about: `I am currently a student at New York University dual-majoring in Data Science and Computer Science. I am a results-oriented individual with a 
  demonstrated track record of designing and developing ML frameworks,
  data pipelines, and business intelligence tools. 
  The power in influencing the future is the drive that propels my pursuit to identify, design, and develop 
  frameworks across the vast uncharted potentials of the data-driven world.
  When not in the classroom I delegate my time to research in the discovery of applying new technologies to solve real-world problems.
  Among other things I am also a passionate skier, DJ, pianist, and music producer.
